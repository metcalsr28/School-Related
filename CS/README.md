## EPill Medicine Tracker
This directory contains a concept that I pitched alongside my audio-roguelike concept. Ultimately, this idea was scrapped by me as the audio roguelike was recieving far more traction from my professors and inspired a greater passion in me personally. The audio roguelike later went on to win best capstone and this project remains unfinished.
